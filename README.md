Game - Wizard Wars

This application was created using Ruby, the best way to run it is to have Ruby installed. If using Windows you may
use the "allinoneruby" .exe that is included to run this without having Ruby installed and from anywhere, for instance
from a USB. For ease a you can run the .bat on Windows and Voila!
